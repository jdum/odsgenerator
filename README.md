# odsgenerator, an .ods generator.

Generate an OpenDocument Format `.ods` file from a `.json` or `.yaml` file.


When used as a script, `odsgenerator` parses a JSON or YAML description of
tables and generates an ODF document using the `odfdo` library.

When used as a library, `odsgenerator` parses a Python description of tables
and returns the ODF content as bytes (ready to be saved as a valid ODF document).

-  The content description can be minimalist: a list of lists of lists,
-  or description can be complex, allowing styles at row or cell level.

See also https://github.com/jdum/odsparsator which is doing the reverse
operation, `.osd` to `.json`.

`odsgenerator` is a `Python3` package, using the [odfdo](https://github.com/jdum/odfdo) library. Current version requires Python >= 3.9, see prior versions for older environments.

pip install .
```


## CLI usage

```
odsgenerator [-h] [--version] input_file output_file
```

### arguments


``input_file``: input file containing data in JSON or YAML format

``output_file``: output file, `.ods` file generated from the input

Use ``odsgenerator --help`` for more details about input file parameters
and look at examples in the tests folder.


## Usage from python code

```python
import odsgenerator

content = odsgenerator.ods_bytes([[["a", "b", "c"], [10, 20, 30]]])
with open("sample.ods", "wb") as file:
    file.write(content)
```

The resulting `.ods` file loaded in a spreadsheet:

Another example with more parameters:

```python
import odsgenerator

content = odsgenerator.ods_bytes(
    [
        {
            "name": "first tab",
            "style": "cell_decimal2",
            "table": [
                {
                    "row": ["a", "b", "c"],
                    "style": "bold_center_bg_gray_grid_06pt",
                },
                [10, 20, 30],
            ],
        }
    ]
)
with open("sample2.ods", "wb") as file:
    file.write(content)
```

The `.ods` file loaded in a spreadsheet, with gray background on first line:

## Principle

-  A document is a list or dict containing tabs,
-  a tab is a list or dict containing rows,
-  a row is a list or dict containing cells.
